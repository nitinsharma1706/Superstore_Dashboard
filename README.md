# Superstore_Dashboard
This project involves the creation of an interactive dashboard using Power BI and Power Query. The dataset used is the Superstore sales data. The step-by-step process of the project is as follows:

- **Dataset Preparation**: The Superstore sales data is obtained and imported into Power Query for data cleaning and transformation.

- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Using Power Query, the data is cleaned by removing irrelevant columns, filtering out unnecessary data, and handling missing values. Transformation steps are applied to ensure the data is in a suitable format for analysis.

- **Dashboard Design**: The cleaned dataset is connected to Power BI, where an interactive and visually appealing dashboard is designed. Various visualizations, such as tables, charts, and graphs, are added to present key insights from the sales data.

- **Interactive Filters**: Filters are implemented in the dashboard to allow users to slice and dice the data based on different dimensions like region, category, and product. This enhances the exploratory capabilities of the dashboard.

- **Calculated Measures**: Using the DAX formula language, calculated measures are created to derive additional insights from the data. Examples of calculated measures include sales growth, profit margin, and customer lifetime value.
