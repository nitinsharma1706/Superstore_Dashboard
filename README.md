# Superstore_Dashboard

The Sales Superstore Dashboard project aims to analyze and visualize the sales performance of a retail company using the Sales Superstore dataset. The dashboard provides actionable insights into sales trends, customer behavior, product performance, geographical analysis, order and shipping data, and profitability. By leveraging data visualization and analytics, the dashboard helps optimize sales, improve customer management, and drive business growth.

## Problems aimed to solve
- Sales Analysis and Performance Monitoring
- Customer Segmentation and Behavior Analysis
- Product Performance and Inventory Management
- Geographical Analysis and Market Insights
- Order and Shipping Analysis
- Profitability and Cost Analysis

## Methodlogy

- **Dataset Preparation**: The Superstore sales data is obtained and imported into Power Query for data cleaning and transformation.

- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Using Power Query, the data is cleaned by removing irrelevant columns, filtering out unnecessary data, and handling missing values. Transformation steps are applied to ensure the data is in a suitable format for analysis.

- **Dashboard Design**: The cleaned dataset is connected to Power BI, where an interactive and visually appealing dashboard is designed. Various visualizations, such as charts, and graphs, are added to present key insights from the sales data.

- **Interactive Filters**: Filters are implemented in the dashboard to allow users to slice and dice the data based on different dimensions like region, Segment, and product. This enhances the exploratory capabilities of the dashboard.

- **Calculated Measures**: Using the DAX formula language, calculated measures are created to derive additional insights from the data. Examples of calculated measures include sales growth, and sum of sales.
